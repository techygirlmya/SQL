# **SQL Portfolio**
## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've been working on. Have a look around and reach out if you have any questions.
### This repository documents my progress through the Break Into Tech: SQL certification. The projects showcase the practical, job-ready SQL skills necessary for an entry-level data analyst or business intelligence role. My work here validates my ability to use SQL to extract actionable insights from relational databases, a critical skill for making data-driven decisions. The repository covers a wide range of topics, including data retrieval using complex queries with JOINs, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses; data manipulation with UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements; and data aggregation using functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG. I've applied these skills to solve real-world business problems, such as analyzing sales performance or customer behavior.
